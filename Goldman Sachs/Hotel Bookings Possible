He wants to find out whether there are enough rooms in the hotel to satisfy the demand. Write a program that solves this problem in time O(N log N) .


Input Format

First argument is an integer array A containing arrival time of booking.
Second argument is an integer array B containing departure time of booking.
Third argument is an integer C denoting the count of rooms.


Output Format

Return True if there are enough rooms for N bookings else return False.
Return 0/1 for C programs.


Example Input

Input 1:

 A = [1, 3, 5]
 B = [2, 6, 8]
 C = 1



Example Output
