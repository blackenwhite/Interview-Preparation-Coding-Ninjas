Given a generic tree, count and return the number of leaf nodes present in the given tree.
Input format :
Elements in level order form separated by space (as per done in class). Order is - 
Root_data, n (No_Of_Child_Of_Root), n children, and so on for every element 
Output Format :
Count of leaf nodes
Sample Input 1 :
10 3 20 30 40 2 40 50 0 0 0 0 
Sample Output 1 :
4

     * Don't read input, it is passed as function argument.
     * Return output and don't print it.
     * Taking input and printing output is handled automatically.
