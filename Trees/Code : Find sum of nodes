Given a generic tree, count and return the sum of all nodes present in the given tree.
Input format :
Elements in level order form separated by space (as per done in class). Order is - 
Root_data, n (No_Of_Child_Of_Root), n children, and so on for every element 
Output Format :
Sum of all nodes
Sample Input :
10 3 20 30 40 2 40 50 0 0 0 0 
Sample Output :
190

     * Don't read input, it is passed as function argument.
     * Return output and don't print it.
     * Taking input and printing output is handled automatically.

    int sum=root->data;

        sum+=sumOfNodes(root->children[i]);
